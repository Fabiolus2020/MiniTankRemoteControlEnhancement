Finally Completed robot recon 1.0


functionality:

The bot has 4 different driving modes, mode 1&2 are PWM control but developed  differently and produce better control.

Mode 3&4 utilize potentiometers to control speed of the motors, mode 4 control the motors independently using the potentiometers.

For the final enhancement I decided to tryout individual addressable LED strip, it was quite a challenge to understand debouncing and make everything work with button press, keeping counts, resetting led strip etc...

Both orange buttons are to cycle backward/forward through the LED mode. There are two modes for lights. Mode 1 simple white bright light forward, backward, left, right, all lights on. Mode 2 is a show LED display and can cycle through 5 different patterns. Motors  are functional while LEDs are on!


Well this is it for this project.
